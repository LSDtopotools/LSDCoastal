= Land Surface Dynamics coastal scripts

This repository contains scripts used for coastal environments by the Land Surface Dynamics Groups at the university of Edinburgh.

== Scripts within the repository

=== ParseTidalData.py

This script contains routines to parse tide guage data. At the moment (January 2017) it contains only routines to parse data from Malaysian records. In the future it will be extended to other data formats. 

In addition to parsing data files (and example is in the file *CENDERING2015.csv*) it also computes inundation times and fractions.

==== Usage:

Simply run the program. Near the bottom of the ParseTidalData.py file there is a path and filename; this must be modified to match the path and name of your own file.
